detail of all unreconciled lines with amount on currencies, financial amount
and cumulative amounts

By default all lines of same document are grouped and minimun maturity date of the move line is shown, you can change this behaviur by:
#. Create / modify parameter "account_debt_management.date_maturity_type" with one of the following values:
    #. detail: lines will be splitted by maturity date
    #. max: one line per document, max maturity date shown
    #. min (default value if no parameter or no matching): one line per document, min maturity date shown.
