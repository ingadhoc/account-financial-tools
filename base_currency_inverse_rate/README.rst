==========================
Base Currency Inverse Rate
==========================

In some countries we are use to see exchange rate in the inverse way as odoo
shows it. We show rate FROM base currency and not TO base currency. For eg.
#. Base Currency ARS: 1.0
#. USD rate: 12.0 (in odoo way 1 / 12.0 = 0.0833)
